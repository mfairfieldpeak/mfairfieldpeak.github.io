Project done as a GeoEnvironmental Analysis Technician at the Center for Applied Environmental and Geospatial Technology.

In Phase II of the project, the goal was to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and real-time GIS tools to enhance the SRBCâ€™s data-driven methods, providing more accurate and timely results, and enabling more efficient, effective, and pragmatic decision-making.

The first steps in this project were data collection and management. The computer science team received SRBC historical datasets for water quality, which allowed them to validate the ability to convert the data for the use of AI and Data Analytics. As the computer science team was developing the machine learning predictive model, the Center was brought in to create an Operational Dashboard to house the model. Knowing that this model will be used by SRBC, the Center created a dashboard that was all-in-one with sub-basin selectors, viewing capabilities of major watersheds, and site information of the remote data collection locations. The final piece of the dashboard is the predictive model which was presented in a graph displaying 7-day predictions of water conductance.

This project is now on Phase 3, working on the accuracies of the AI model and enhancing the dashboard to include more capabilities.
