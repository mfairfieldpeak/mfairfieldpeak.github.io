Project done as a GeoEnvironmental Analysis Technician at the Center for Applied Environmental and Geospatial Technology.

Working alongside Messiah University, the Harrisburg Redlined Interactive Map was created to show the results of a survey carried out by federal agents of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC). Between 1935 and 1936, the survey was conducted to pinpoint parts of the city and surrounding communities that they judged worthy of investment through government-backed housing loans. The survey gathered information about the property and population of Harrisburg and its surrounding communities in order to divide inhabited zones into four distinct grades: “Best,” “Still Desirable,” “Definitely Declining,” and “Hazardous.” These insurance grades effectively ensured that private and public housing loans were awarded to communities and neighborhoods according to their racial, ethnic, and economic characteristics. 

At the beginning of this project, the Center was given a digital copy of the original survey map from 1936, and a digitized dataset of the communities in Harrisburg, PA. From those documents, the Center compiled a dataset by including notes taken from the survey record, including the population of the area broken down by race and ethnicity, and the final grade of the communities. The final grades were then used to symbolize the communities just as they were on the original survey map and added into the interactive Story Map platform.
